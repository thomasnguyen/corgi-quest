# Corgi Quest Documentation

This folder contains auto-generated documentation maintained by Kiro agent hooks.

## Files

### `schema-overview.md`
Auto-generated by the Schema Documentation Hook when `convex/schema.ts` changes.

Documents:
- All 11 Convex tables
- Field types and relationships
- Real-time subscription patterns
- Frontend dependencies

### `training-mode-pipeline.md`
Auto-generated by the Training Mode Documentation Hook when training components change.

Documents:
- Voice input flow (Web Speech API + OpenAI Realtime)
- AI parsing and activity extraction
- Convex mutations and database updates
- Real-time UI updates

### `spec-summaries/`
Auto-generated summaries of feature specs from `.kiro/specs/`.

## How It Works

These docs are automatically updated by Kiro agent hooks:

1. You edit a source file (schema, component, spec)
2. You save the file
3. Kiro detects the change via hook trigger
4. Kiro analyzes the changes
5. Kiro updates the relevant documentation
6. You review and commit the changes

This ensures documentation stays in sync with code without manual effort.

## Manual Updates

While these files are auto-generated, you can manually edit them if needed. Just be aware that the next hook trigger will overwrite your changes based on the source files.

If you want to preserve manual content:
- Add a "Manual Notes" section at the bottom
- Update the hook prompt to preserve that section
- Or create a separate manual doc file
